      <p>Hello stranger! My name is Hyung Gun Kim, but you can also call me Chris. I am currently a third year UC Berkeley student majoring in Economics and minoring in Computer Science. I recently became interested in the blockchain technology and decided to develop my skills in computer science. I truly believe the blockchain technology is what the future is about. If you want to know what Blockchain Technology is, checkout my webpage <a href="https://iskysun96.github.io/What-is-Blockchain-Technology/" target="_blank" title="What is Blockchain Technology?">"What is Blockchain Technology?"</a> I am also passionate about music. I write songs, sing, and play the guitar. I recorded an EP consisting 5 songs back in 2015. A lot of my music is inspired by Ed Sheeran, John Mayer, and Sara Bareilles. Thank you for checking out my portfolio and I look forward to getting to know you! </p>
