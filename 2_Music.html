      <h2>How I Started Music</h2>
      <p>I was an ordinary highschool kid, who first came to the United States to learn English. I had no interest in music at all. But then I fell in love with a girl, like most highschool boy. She moved to the school I was attending on my sophmore year, and I was put in a songwriting class with her. She showed the class her song by singing and playing her guitar. At that moment I fell in love with her and music. That is the moment my life in music started branching out. I believe in the power of music and how it can move people's hearts; a lot of my songs contain certain messages that focus on bringing warmth and love in to the world. If you would like to check out the EP I released in 2015 called, "A Perfect World" check out this link below. </p>
